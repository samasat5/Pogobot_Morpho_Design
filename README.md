During a two-month internship at ISIR Lab, Sorbonne university, the best hardware design for the Pogobots (Sorbone-made swarm robots) to move forward
in a straight and fast manner had yet to be dicovered. In the pursuit of the best exoskeleton, a formulation of guidelines and criteria through an iterative process of design, printing, testing, and refinement was proposed. A model was then proposed and demonstrated to outperform the toothbrush-based design on the tested surface. Additionally, 
the exoskeletonâ€™s performance on lower-performing robots was examined, revealing significant stochasticity in their movement behavior. Finally, suggestions for future research 
were proposed.
