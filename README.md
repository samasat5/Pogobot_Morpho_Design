During a two-month internship at ISIR Lab, Sorbonne Univeristy, we investigated the best hardware design for the Pogobots (Sorboone-made swarm robots) to move forward
in a straight and fast way. Initially, the early stages of exoskeleton design were reviewed, leading to the formulation of guidelines and criteria through an iterative
process of design, printing, testing, and refinement. A model was then proposed and demonstrated to outperform the toothbrush-based design on the tested surface. Additionally, 
the exoskeletonâ€™s performance on lower-performing robots was examined, revealing significant stochasticity in their movement behavior. Finally, suggestions for future research 
were proposed.
